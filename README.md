## Introduction

This project aims to use DOM manipulation to create an interactive 'Etch-a-Sketch' application.

The application will allow a user to generate a n by n grid of interactive divs, which will change color on mouseover. This will allow the user to draw on the grid, similar to an Etch-a-Sketch.
